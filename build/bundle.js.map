The curried function has two unusual capabilities. First, its\n\t     * arguments needn't be provided one at a time. If `g` is `R.curryN(3, f)`, the\n\t     * following are equivalent:\n\t     *\n\t     *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t     *\n\t     * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify\n\t     * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\n\t     * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n\t     * following are equivalent:\n\t     *\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.5.0\n\t     * @category Function\n\t     * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t     * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n\t     * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t     * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t     * @see R.curry\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n\t     *\n\t     *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n\t     *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t     *      var g = f(3);\n\t     *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t     */\n\t    var curryN = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n\t        if (length === 1) {\n\t            return _curry1(fn);\n\t        }\n\t        return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Decrements its argument.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.9.0\n\t     * @category Math\n\t     * @sig Number -> Number\n\t     * @param {Number} n\n\t     * @return {Number}\n\t     * @see R.inc\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      R.dec(42); //=> 41\n\t     */\n\t    var dec = add(-1);\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns the second argument if it is not `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`\n\t     * otherwise the first argument is returned.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.10.0\n\t     * @category Logic\n\t     * @sig a -> b -> a | b\n\t     * @param {a} val The default value.\n\t     * @param {b} val The value to return if it is not null or undefined\n\t     * @return {*} The the second value or the default value\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      var defaultTo42 = R.defaultTo(42);\n\t     *\n\t     *      defaultTo42(null);  //=> 42\n\t     *      defaultTo42(undefined);  //=> 42\n\t     *      defaultTo42('Ramda');  //=> 'Ramda'\n\t     *      defaultTo42(parseInt('string')); //=> 42\n\t     */\n\t    var defaultTo = _curry2(function defaultTo(d, v) {\n\t        return v == null || v !== v ? d : v;\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Finds the set (i.e. no duplicates) of all elements in the first list not\n\t     * contained in the second list.

The curried function\n\t     * has two unusual capabilities. First, its arguments needn't be provided one\n\t     * at a time. If `f` is a ternary function and `g` is `R.curry(f)`, the\n\t     * following are equivalent:\n\t     *\n\t     *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t     *\n\t     * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify\n\t     * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\n\t     * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n\t     * following are equivalent:\n\t     *\n\t     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t     *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.1.0\n\t     * @category Function\n\t     * @sig (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t     * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t     * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t     * @see R.curryN\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      var addFourNumbers = (a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d;\n\t     *\n\t     *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curry(addFourNumbers);\n\t     *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t     *      var g = f(3);\n\t     *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t     */\n\t    var curry = _curry1(function curry(fn) {\n\t        return curryN(fn.length, fn);\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns all but the first `n` elements of the given list, string, or\n\t     * transducer/transformer (or object with a `drop` method).\n\t     *\n\t     * Dispatches to the `drop` method of the second argument, if present.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.1.0\n\t     * @category List\n\t     * @sig Number -> [a] -> [a]\n\t     * @sig Number -> String -> String\n\t     * @param {Number} n\n\t     * @param {*} list\n\t     * @return {*}\n\t     * @see R.take, R.transduce\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      R.drop(1, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['bar', 'baz']\n\t     *      R.drop(2, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['baz']\n\t     *      R.drop(3, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\n\t     *      R.drop(4, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\n\t     *      R.drop(3, 'ramda');               //=> 'da'\n\t     */\n\t    var drop = _curry2(_dispatchable('drop', _xdrop, function drop(n, xs) {\n\t        return slice(Math.max(0, n), Infinity, xs);\n\t    }));\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns a list containing all but the last `n` elements of the given `list`.\n\t     *\n\t     * @func\n\t     * @memberOf R\n\t     * @since v0.16.0\n\t     * @category List\n\t     * @sig Number -> [a] -> [a]\n\t     * @sig Number -> String -> String\n\t     * @param {Number} n The number of elements of `xs` to skip.\n\t     * @param {Array} xs The collection to consider.\n\t     * @return {Array}\n\t     * @see R.takeLast\n\t     * @example\n\t     *\n\t     *      R.dropLast(1, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['foo', 'bar']\n\t     *      R.dropLast(2, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['foo']\n\t     *      R.dropLast(3, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\n\t     *      R.dropLast(4, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\n\t     *      R.dropLast(3, 'ramda');               //=> 'ra'\n\t     */\n\t    var dropLast = _curry2(_dispatchable('dropLast', _xdropLast, _dropLast));\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns a new list containing all but last the`n` elements of a given list,\n\t     * passing each value from the right to the supplied predicate function,\n\t     * skipping elements while the predicate function returns `true`.
